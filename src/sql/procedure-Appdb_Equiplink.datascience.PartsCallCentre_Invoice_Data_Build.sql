-- AUGUSTO'S COMMENT
-- The new views are good but processing of invoices that way will take a long time.
-- As suggestions:
-- 1)	Need to change the proc part to do 2 separate inserts instead of 1 insert based on a UNION ALL.
-- 2)	This should be done incrementally. Reprocessing the entire dataset every time consumes a lot of resources. Once an Invoice was persisted to your [datascience].[PartsCallCentre_invoice_data] table it doesnâ€™t need to be reprocessed.
